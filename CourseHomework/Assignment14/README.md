### Required Techniques

1. **3+ Pages**  
   The website contains three pages: Home, Portfolio, and About. These pages maintain a cohesive minimalist and professional theme, similar to the design of **Imprint Creations**.

2. **Framework Integration**  
   The website uses the Bootstrap CSS framework to improve layout and responsiveness.

3. **Framework Styling Elements**  
   The site uses Bootstrap's predefined styling components such as navigation bars, buttons, and grid systems to ensure consistency and visual appeal.

4. **HTML5 Canvas**  
   An HTML5 canvas is used on the home page to display a simple animation (bouncing ball) that enhances the visual aspect of the portfolio.

5. **JavaScript Functionality**  
   JavaScript is used for interactivity, including a toggleable navigation bar and dynamic animations using the HTML5 canvas.
