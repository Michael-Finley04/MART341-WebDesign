This week, I worked on the **homepage (index.html)**.

1. **Class Selector:** 
   I used the `.content-section` class to style multiple content areas consistently.

2. **ID Selector:**
   I applied the `#site-header` ID to uniquely style the header with a specific background color and padding.

3. **Background Colors:** 
   I added contrasting background colors to different sections for emphasis.

4. **Text Alignment:** 
   Text alignment was adjusted for headings (centered) and paragraphs (left-aligned) to improve readability.

5. **Borders:**
   Borders were added around images to highlight them without cluttering the design.

## Why These Techniques?
These techniques align with the minimalist aesthetic of the site while improving visual hierarchy and balance.

## Future Improvements
- Refine negative space for a more cohesive look.
- Experiment with subtle textures for depth.
