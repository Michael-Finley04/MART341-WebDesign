Professional Business Portfolio

Iâ€™ve chosen to develop the professional business portfolio site. This idea aligns well with my goal to showcase a variety of creative projects in a clean, minimalist format that allows the work to take center stage. The tone will remain professional and modern, emphasizing simplicity to make the visual content stand out.

In my webiste deisgn I was able to take the conpets of balance and apply it directly into my website. I wanted the site to use minimalism and white space to provide aprofessional look. The deisgn ended up turning out tthe wya that I wnated it so I did not have to make changes. I run into some issues with balance, I'm sturgglinto fully master balance on the site and still beleive that I can make imporvments.
