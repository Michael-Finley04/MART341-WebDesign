## Project Overview

## Required Elements

### 1. **Three or More Pages**
- The project includes **four pages**: `index.html`, `about.html`, `services.html`, and `contact.html`.
- These pages are linked together through a navigation bar to ensure easy access and flow across the site.

### 2. **Clear, Well-Organized Layout with Strong Usability**
- The layout is simple, with consistent sections on each page. 
- The navigation bar is located at the top of each page for easy access to other sections of the website.
- Clear call-to-action buttons such as “Explore Our Services” on the homepage to guide users toward the next steps.
- The website is organized with a responsive design to ensure compatibility across desktop and mobile devices.

### 3. **Use of an External Stylesheet**
- All CSS is in an external `style.css` file. This separation of concerns ensures maintainability and reusability.
- The CSS file defines styles for common elements such as headers, footers, and navigation links, ensuring consistency across all pages.

### 4. **Application of At Least One Font**
- The website uses the default system font `Arial`, which is easy to read and universally available, enhancing usability.
- Further custom fonts could be added if needed in the future for enhanced branding.

### 5. **Incorporation of At Least One Image**
- The homepage (index.html) features a hero section with a welcome message, along with a placeholder for an image that could represent the business. 

### 6. **Embedded Media Element (Video, Audio, etc.)**
- The site is designed to be flexible, and a video or Google Maps embed could be added to the `about.html` or `contact.html` pages.
### 7. **Structural and Semantic HTML Markup**
- The HTML structure includes semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, and `<section>`, which enhance both accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).
- Proper use of heading tags (h1, h2, etc.) provides clarity for both users and search engines.

### 8. **Legible, Well-Commented, and Error-Free Code**
- The code is well commented throughout, explaining the structure and purpose of different sections.
- The HTML and CSS code has been thoroughly tested to ensure it’s error-free, with careful attention to syntax and structure.

## Techniques Used and Implementation Rationale

### 1. **Navigation Bar**
- **Why:** A top navigation bar was implemented for easy access to different pages of the website. This ensures a smooth user experience by providing a consistent navigation structure on each page.
- **How:** The navigation bar is created using an unordered list `<ul>` and `<li>` elements, with each list item containing an anchor tag `<a>` to link to the respective pages.

### 2. **Responsive Design**
- **Why:** To ensure the website is usable on both desktop and mobile devices, I applied responsive web design techniques using flexible layouts and a viewport meta tag.
- **How:** The CSS ensures that elements scale appropriately across different screen sizes, with the navigation bar switching to a mobile-friendly layout on smaller screens.

### 3. **External Stylesheet**
- **Why:** Using an external stylesheet allows the design to be separated from the HTML structure, making the website easier to maintain and update in the future.
- **How:** All CSS rules are contained in a single `style.css` file, which is linked in the `<head>` section of each HTML page.

### 4. **Semantic HTML Tags**
- **Why:** Using semantic HTML tags enhances accessibility, SEO, and code readability.
- **How:** Tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<section>` are used to structure the document logically, making it easier for both humans and search engines to understand the content.

### 5. **Placeholder for Image**
- **Why:** A placeholder image was added to the homepage’s hero section to give a more professional and engaging first impression.
- **How:** The image is placed using a `background-image` in the CSS, with room to replace it with a real image when available.
